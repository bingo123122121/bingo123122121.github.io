I'm an undergraduate student in the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://www.bit.edu.cn/)). I'm an imcoming PhD candidate at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ICT/CAS](http://www.ict.ac.cn/)), and will be supervised by Prof. [Yang Feng](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~yangfeng?language=en) in ICT Natural Language Processing ([ICTNLP](http://nlp.ict.ac.cn/)) group.

My main research interests are nature language processing and machine translation, particularly multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT).
