I'm a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ICT/CAS](http://www.ict.ac.cn/)), supervised by Prof. [Yang Feng](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~yangfeng?language=en) in ICT Natural Language Processing ([ICTNLP](http://nlp.ict.ac.cn/)) group. Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree at Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://www.bit.edu.cn/)).

My main research interests are **multilingual large language model (LLM)** and **multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT)**.

News
