I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ICT/CAS](http://www.ict.ac.cn/)), supervised by Prof. [Yang Feng](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~yangfeng?language=en) in ICT Natural Language Processing ([ICTNLP](http://nlp.ict.ac.cn/)) group. Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree at Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://www.bit.edu.cn/)).

My main research interests are **multilingual large language model (LLM)** and **multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT)**.

======
[2025.11:rocket:] Excited to attend EMNLP 2025 in Suzhou! I‚Äôll be presenting our paper *AlignX: Advancing Multilingual Large Language Models with Multilingual Representation Alignment* at the poster session on Friday, November 7, 10:30‚Äì12:00.

[2025.8üéâ] One first-author paper about enhancing LLM's multilingual capability is accepted to EMNLP2025 Main Conference!

[2025.1üéâ] One paper about byte-based multilingual neural machine translation is accepted to MAACL2025 Main Conference!

[2024.5üéâ] One first-author paper about multilingual neural machine translation is accepted to ACL2024 Findings!

[2023.9üëè] I start my Ph.D. life at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/))!

[2023.6üëè] I obtain my B.E. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://www.bit.edu.cn/))!

[2023.6üéâ] Our LLM BayLing (ÁôæËÅÜ) is released! BayLing is an instruction-following LLM with advanced language alignment and multi-turn interaction capability. Read our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10968) and try our online [demo](http://nlp.ict.ac.cn/bayling/demo/)! Thanks to all collaborators!
