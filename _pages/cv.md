🔥News
======
[2025.11:rocket:] Excited to attend EMNLP 2025 in Suzhou! I’ll be presenting our paper *AlignX: Advancing Multilingual Large Language Models with Multilingual Representation Alignment* at the poster session on Friday, November 7, 10:30–12:00.

[2025.8🎉] One first-author paper about enhancing LLM's multilingual capability is accepted to EMNLP2025 Main Conference!

[2025.1🎉] One paper about byte-based multilingual neural machine translation is accepted to MAACL2025 Main Conference!

[2024.5🎉] One first-author paper about multilingual neural machine translation is accepted to ACL2024 Findings!

[2023.9👏] I start my Ph.D. life at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/))!

[2023.6👏] I obtain my B.E. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://www.bit.edu.cn/))!

[2023.6🎉] Our LLM BayLing (百聆) is released! BayLing is an instruction-following LLM with advanced language alignment and multi-turn interaction capability. Read our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10968) and try our online [demo](http://nlp.ict.ac.cn/bayling/demo/)! Thanks to all collaborators!
